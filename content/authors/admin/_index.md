Hi there! I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), advised by [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/) and [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/). I do research in natural language processing.

I graduated in June 2020 from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) with majors in computer science and math. There, I was super fortunate to learn about the world of research through natural language processing and computer audition with Professor [Doug Downey](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ddowney/), Professor [Bryan Pardo](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~pardo/), and Dr. [Prem Seetharaman](https://pseeth.github.io/).
